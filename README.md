# Sclera - Heroku Database Connector

This component enables Sclera to work with your data stored in [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org) database [hosted at Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/postgres).

You just need to link your Heroku PostgreSQL database with Sclera, then import the metadata of select tables within the database. All this gets done in a couple of commands -- and enables you to include these tables within your Sclera queries.

Details on how to link your Heroku PostgreSQL source to with Sclera can be found in the [Sclera Database System Connection Reference](https://www.scleradb.com/doc/ref/dbms#connecting-to-heroku-postgres) document.
